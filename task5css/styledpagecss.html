        My pet dog's name is Bruno. He is from the breed of German Shepherds.
        He is 2 years old, fluffy and black and brown in colour.
        He gets delighted to see me when I come back from school.
        He protects our house from intruders, especially at night.
        He spends most of his time with me and my Dad.
        He is very gentle with us but gets extremely aggressive when he spots a stranger.
        He goes with my father for morning walks and with me for evening walks.
        We provide him with healthy food, fresh milk and meat.
        He loves playing, jumping and running. He is very active all the time.
        When I am upset, he cheers me up by licking me and showering lots of love. I love him so much.
